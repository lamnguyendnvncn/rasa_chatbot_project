      I'm on the website today to follow up and check the [status](recruiting_information) of a position I recently applied for.
  - text: |
      My question is about my application. I just received and automated call that said I hadn't finished the assessment test portion of my application, but I had in fact finished it yesterday. When I view my application online it no longer gives me the option to view or take an assessment test, so I just wanted to make sure everything was alright with my application.
